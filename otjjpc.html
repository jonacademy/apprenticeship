    <h1>Junior Production Coordinator: OTJ Guide</h1>
    
    <div class="rule-box">
        <strong>The "New Learning" Principle:</strong> Off-the-Job (OTJ) training is defined as learning which is undertaken outside of the day-to-day work duties and lead towards the achievement of the apprenticeship. It must be completed during your normal working hours in the UK.
    </div>

    <h2>Comprehensive List of OTJ Activities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Specialised Software Training:</span> Time spent learning Movie Magic Scheduling, Final Draft, or advanced Excel for production budgeting.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Production Paperwork Masterclasses:</span> Learning the legalities of drafting call sheets, risk assessments, and location agreements for the first time.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Industry Research:</span> Studying the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, ASA regulations, or specific broadcaster editorial guidelines (e.g., BBC, ITV, Channel 4).</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Technical Shadowing:</span> Observing a Post-Production Supervisor during a grade or dubbing session to understand the delivery pipeline.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Financial Mentoring:</span> Structured 1-2-1 sessions with a Line Producer discussing production finance, insurance claims, or union rates (BECTU/Equity).</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Sustainable Practice:</span> Learning how to use the 'albert' carbon calculator or implementing a new green production workflow.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Legal & Business Affairs:</span> Reading and understanding contributor release forms, music clearances, and underlying rights.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Portfolio Development:</span> Writing reflective accounts or organising evidence specifically for your End Point Assessment (EPA).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Learning vs. Doing: The Transition</h2>
    <p>A crucial part of your apprenticeship is the transition from <strong>learning</strong> a skill to <strong>applying</strong> it. Once a task becomes part of your regular, independent routine, it is no longer OTJ.</p>

    <div class="grid">
        <div class="box counts">
            <h3 style="color: #00b894;">✅ Counts as OTJ</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Instruction:</strong> Being taught how to draft a risk assessment by a Production Manager.</li>
                <li><strong>Expert Discussion:</strong> A meeting where an expert explains the <em>theory</em> or <em>strategy</em> behind a production decision.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback Sessions:</strong> Reviewing a piece of work with your mentor where you receive constructive guidance on how to improve.</li>
                <li><strong>New Scenarios:</strong> Learning how to manage an international shoot for the first time if you have previously only done UK shoots.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="box no-count">
            <h3 style="color: #d63031;">❌ Does NOT Count</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Repeated Tasks:</strong> Drafting your 15th risk assessment once you already know the process. This is now "Business as Usual."</li>
                <li><strong>Operational Updates:</strong> Standard production catch-ups where the team simply discusses the status of current tasks.</li>
                <li><strong>General Admin:</strong> Responding to emails, booking standard travel, or general office maintenance.</li>
                <li><strong>Functional Skills:</strong> Any time spent on Level 2 English or Maths (this is funded separately).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Example Log Entry</h2>
    <p>Use the following structure to ensure your learning is captured in a way that satisfies the auditors:</p>
    
    <div class="log-entry">
        <p><span class="log-label">Activity Type:</span> Mentoring & Professional Discussion</p>
        <p><span class="log-label">Duration:</span> 60 Minutes</p>
        <p><span class="log-label">Description:</span> Structured 1-2-1 session with the Line Producer regarding the negotiation of freelance crew contracts. We discussed the differences between BECTU guidelines and company-specific deal memos, focusing on overtime triggers and kit rental agreements.</p>
        <p><span class="log-label">Learning Outcome:</span> I have gained a new understanding of the legal requirements for crew engagement and how to calculate potential budgetary overages based on various shift patterns. This knowledge will allow me to assist more effectively with financial forecasting.</p>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 0.9rem; text-align: center; color: #636e72;">
        <em>Remember: If you didn't learn something new, you can't log it as OTJ!</em>
